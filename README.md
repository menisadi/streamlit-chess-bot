# Blind-Chess Chat-Bot 🚀

Welcome to the Blind-Chess Chat-Bot! This simple Streamlit app is a toy project where you can play chess without seeing the board. Currently, the bot makes moves randomly, but there are plans to enhance its capabilities in the future.

## Getting Started 🛠️

To try out the app locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/menisadi/streamlit-chess-bot.git
cd blind-chess-chatbot
streamlit run app.py
```
